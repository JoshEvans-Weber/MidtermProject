## Water Usage Billing System

In this assignment, you will create a Python program to calculate a water bill based on the number of gallons used in a household. The water bill will be determined using a tiered pricing structure, where different prices per gallon apply to different usage levels. The goal is to develop a program that calculates the total water bill for a household based on their water consumption.

## Task 1: Basic Water Billing

Python Module: `Python Variables`

Create a Python script that takes user input for the number of gallons of water used in a household.
Calculate and display the total water bill for the household based on the given input.

### Test Task 1
Sample Prompt: 
```
How many gallons you used this month? 
```

Sample Output: 
```
You Used ## gallons, your bill is $#.##
```
Sample run
```
> python task1.py 
How many gallons you used this month? 2
You used 2 gallons, your bill is $0.16
```

Sample test code
```
> pytest test_task1.py
========================================== test session starts ===========================================
test_task1.py ....                                                                                 [100%]

## Task 2: Basic Water Billing with minimum charge

Python Module: `Basic Conditionals (branching)`

Extend your program to include a basic pricing structure for water usage.
- Define a basic billing structure with a flat rate for the first 2,000 gallons and an additional rate for any gallons used beyond 2,000.
- Calculate and display the total water bill for the household based on the given input.

### Test Task 2
Sample Prompt: 
```
How many gallons you used this month? 
```

Sample Output: 
```
You Used ## gallons, your bill is $#.##
```
Sample run
```
> python task2.py 
How many gallons you used this month? 2010
You used 2010 gallons, your bill is $30.80
```

Test code
```
> pytest test_task2.py
========================================== test session starts ===========================================
test_task2.py ....                                                                                 [100%]

## Task 3: Tier Water Billing

Python Module: `Intermediate Conditionals (Branching)`

Extend your program to include a tiered pricing structure for water usage.
Define multiple tiers, each with its own price per gallon. For example, consider three tiers: 0-2,000 gallons, 2,001-5,000 gallons, and over 5,000 gallons.
- Calculate the water bill by applying the appropriate rate for each tier based on the user's input.
- Display the total water bill, along with a breakdown of charges for each tier.

### Test Task 3
Sample Prompt: 
```
How many gallons you used this month? 
```

Sample Output:
```
You used ## gallons, your bill is $##.##
Tier1 (0-2000): 2000 gallons,  $##.##
Tier2 (2001-5000): 2210 gallons,  $##.##
Tier3 (more than 5000): 0 gallons,  $##.##
```

Sample run
```
> python task3.py 
How many gallons you used this month? 2010
You used 2010 gallons, your bill is $30.80
```
Test code
```
> python task3.py
How many gallons you used this month? 5120
You used 5120 gallons, your bill is $294.00
Tier1 (0-2000): 2000 gallons,  $30.00
Tier2 (2001-5000): 3000 gallons,  $240.00
Tier3 (more than 5000): 120 gallons,  $24.00
```
Test code
```
> pytest test_task3.py
========================================== test session starts ===========================================
test_task3.py ....                                                                                 [100%]

```
## Task 4: Total Year Bill

Python Module: `Loops`

Extend your program to include a tiered pricing structure for water usage, for a year of usage. The twelve-month usage will come from a list of 12 integers.
- Define multiple tiers, each with its own price per gallon. For example, consider three tiers: 0-2,000 gallons, 2,001-5,000 gallons, and over 5,000 gallons.
- Loop over the list and calculate the water bill by applying the appropriate rate for each tier based on each item of the list.
- Display the total water bill for the year, along with a breakdown of charges for each tier.

### Test Task 4

Sample Output:
```
You used ## gallons, your bill is $##.##
Tier1 (0-2000): 2000 gallons,  $##.##
Tier2 (2001-5000): 2210 gallons,  $##.##
Tier3 (more than 5000): 0 gallons,  $##.##
```

Sample run with this sample data:
```python
year_usage = [800, 900, 1500, 2000, 2050, 3000, 
                  3500, 4000, 4500, 5020, 1500, 600]
```
```
> python task4.py 
You used 29370 gallons, your bill is $2388.00
Tier1 (0-2000): 19300 gallons,  $360.00
Tier2 (2001-5000): 10050 gallons,  $2024.00
Tier3 (more than 5001): 20 gallons,  $4.00
```
Test code
```
> pytest test_task4.py
========================================== test session starts ===========================================
test_task4.py ....                                                                                 [100%]

## Task 5: Intermediate Tiered Billing

Python Module: `Functions, Refactoring and Error Handling`

Refactor your code from Task 4 by allowing customization of the tiered pricing structure. Make sure you include functions
- Modify your program to allow the user to define the pricing tiers and their respective rates through user input.
- Implement error handling to ensure that tiers are defined correctly (e.g., in ascending order) and that rates are valid positive numbers.
- Calculate the water bill using the user-defined tiered pricing structure.
- Display the total water bill and the breakdown of charges for each user-defined tier.

### Test Task 5

Sample Output:
```
You used ## gallons, your bill is $##.##
Tier1 (0-2000): 2000 gallons,  $##.##
Tier2 (2001-5000): 2210 gallons,  $##.##
Tier3 (more than 5000): 0 gallons,  $##.##
```

Sample run with this sample data:
```python
year_usage = [800, 900, 1500, 2000, 2050, 3000, 
                  3500, 4000, 4500, 5020, 1500, 600]

Note: You can evaluate the students here based on how many functions they refactored their code. 

For example, if you run `help()` inside the `Python` prompt, you should get something similar to this: 

```
>>> import task5
>>> help(task5)

Help on module task5:
